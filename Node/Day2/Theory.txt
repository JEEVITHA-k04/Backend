1. What is synchronous and asynchoronous process
	
    Synchoronous Process:
       • Synchronous process means tasks run step-by-step in order, one after another
       • The next task starts only after the current task finishes, so the program waits
       • It creates blocking behaviour - if one task takes time ( like reading a file) everything else stops until it completes
       • It is easier to understand and predict because the flow is straight and sequential
       • Mostly used for simpe operatioins where tasks cmoplete quickly and do not involve time-consuming work like netork calls

     Example:
	console.log("Task 1")
	console.log("Task 2")
	console.log("Task 3")

    Asynchoronous Process:
       • Asynchoronoous process means tasks do not wait for each other to finish and run independently
       • When a time-taking tasks start, the program continues to the next task while the first one completes in the background
       • It gives non-blocking behaviour, imporving performance especially for slow operation ike API calls or file reading
       • It requires event loop, callbacks, promises, or async-await to manage the flow
       • Mostly used in server-side programming (Node.js) and modern apps where speed and responsiveness are important

     Example:
	console.log("Task1")
	setTimeout(() => console.log("Task 2"), 2000)
	console.log("Task 3")

Difference:
      Feature	    Synchronous	            Asynchronous

1. Task execution	    One by one	       Parallel / background
2. Waiting	              Waits for each task	            Does not wait
3. Blocking	      Blocking	            Non-blocking
4. Speed	                       Slower	                Faster
5. Example	              Standing in a queue	    Ordering food and waiting at table
6. Used in	            Simple small programs	     Network calls, file read, servers
