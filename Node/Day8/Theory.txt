1. What is MongoDB ? 
 	• MongoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational) database used to store and manage data in a flexible, document-based format instead of traditional rows and columns like SQL databases (e.g., MySQL).
	• MongoDB is NOSQL database which means it doeant use tables and rows like SQL databases; instead, it stores data in flxible, JSON - like documents.
	• Data in MongoDB is stored as documentss inside collections. A collection is like a table, and a document is like a single record (row).
	• Each document contains key-value pairs (like { name : "gv", age : 21} ) and can have a different structure from other documents in the same collections
	• it uses BSOM format internally, which allows it to store more data types than normal JSON (like data, number, array, object, etc.,)
	• schema flexiblity : you dont need to predefine columns or data types - you can easily add new fielda whatever you want

2. What is ORM ?
	• ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping 
	• It is a technique that helps developers interact with database using objects instead of writing raw SQL queries
	• It acts like a bridge between object-oriented programming(like JS, Python or Java) and relational database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc)
	• ORMs automatically convert your code (object , method, and classes) into SQL queries behind the scenes. This means you dont have to worry about SQL yntax  you just work with your language's onject and method.
	• Common examples of ORM libraries are:
	         1. Sequelize for Node.js
	         2. TypeORM for TypeScript
	         3. Mongoose (a similar concept for MongoDB, though MongoDB is NoSQL)
	         4. Hibernate for Java
	         5. Django ORM for Python

3. Functions in MongoDB
	1. insertOne() - insert a single document into a collection
	2. insertMany() - insert multiple documents at once
	3. find() - retrieves documents from a collection (like SELECT in SQL)
	4. findOne() - return only the first matching documents
	5. updateOne() - update a single documents thet matches a condition
	6. updateMany() - update multiple documents at once
	7. deleteOne() - delete the first matching documents
	8. deleteMany() - delete multiple matching documents
	9. countDocuments() - count the number of documents matching a condition
	10. sort() - sort the result in ascending or decending order
	11. limit() - limits the number of documents displayed
	12. aggregate() - performs complex data operations like grouping, filtering, and summing(used for analytics)

	• Insert data → insertOne(), insertMany()
	• Read data → find(), findOne()
	• Update data → updateOne(), updateMany()
	• Delete data → deleteOne(), deleteMany()
	• Analyze data → aggregate()
